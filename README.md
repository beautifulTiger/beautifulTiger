Hi, my name is Esther ğŸ˜€.
I love creating useful programs and designing websites.
I hope to one day own my own company and help other hardworking kids ğŸ§’ utilize there talents no matter where they live and whatever age they might be.
My hobbies are creating computer ğŸ’» programs, adopting stray cats, reading and drawing manga, watching anime and learning new things.
Reach out to me if you'd like to collaberate and build  awsome software.
